\chapter{Methodology}\label{chapter:methodology}
Our goal here is to build a system that is capable of accurately predicting when the user is going to eat.
This can be achieved by building predictive models and training them on user data.
But, in order to this, we first need to collect data on user's eating patterns.
This process is called dietary assesment.
There are many methods for dietary assesment.
Here, we will be focusing on a mobile-based solution:
We will build a dialog agent that allows for instant logging of a user's dietary intake.
Afterwards, using the gathered data, we will build a machine learning pipeline that predicts the time of the next entry.

\section{Dialog Agent}
\subsection{Design}
\subsubsection{Chatbot Architecture}
We will be building a task-oriented dialog agent.
The task is to understand the eating patterns of the user and make future predictions.
Let's take a look at our task from a frame-based perspective.
What information do we need from the user in order to accomplish this task?
There are many answers to this question with varying complexity.
Keeping the scope of the thesis in mind, we contruct a simple frame shown in \autoref{tab:main_frame}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption[Frame for Logging Dietary Intake]{Frame for Logging Dietary Intake}\label{tab:main_frame}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    Slot&Type&Explanation\\ \toprule
    User Id&int&A user's identifying integer \\ \hline
    Meal Time&Time&Time of the meal\\ \hline
    Meal Date&Date&Date of the meal\\ \hline
    Meal Type&int&Type of the meal, 0 for Snack and 1 for Full Meal \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Now we need to come up with a question for every slot in the frame.
\autoref{tab:logging_questions} shows these questions.
We don't assign questions to User Id and Meal Date slots, as they are meant to be infered from the context.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption[Question for Logging Dietary Intake]{Questions for Logging Dietary Intake}\label{tab:logging_questions}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    Slot&Questions\\ \toprule
    User Id&-\\ \hline
    Meal Time&When was this meal/snack?\\ \hline
    Meal Date&-\\ \hline
    Meal Type&Was this a meal or a snack?\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Based on these questions, we build a simple control structure shown in \autoref{fig:logging_control}.
This control structure follows a mixed initiative approach, 
allowing the user to deliver the information in any sequence.

\usetikzlibrary{automata,positioning}
\tikzstyle{state} = [rectangle,
                    text width=5cm,
                    align = center,
                    draw=black!80,
                    fill=black!5,
                    very thick]
\tikzstyle{control} = [node distance=2cm,
                      trim left=(0),
                      trim right=(0),
                      >=stealth,
                      shorten >=1pt,
                      auto]
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption[Control Structure for Meal Logging]{Control Structure for Meal Logging}\label{fig:logging_control}
  \scalebox{0.6}{
  \begin{tikzpicture}[control]
    \node (0) {Start};
    \node (1) [below left =of 0, xshift=-1cm] [state] {Was this a meal or a snack?};
    \node (2) [below right =of 0, xshift=1cm] [state] {When was this \{1:meal, 0:snack\}[<meal\_type>]?};
    \node (3) [below =of 0, yshift= -2cm] {Save into the database};
    \path[->]
      (0) edge node [swap, midway] {Meal Time acquired} (1)
      (0) edge node [midway] {Meal Type acquired} (2)
      (0) edge node [midway, text width=3cm] {Meal Time and Meal Type acquired} (3)
      (1) edge node [swap, midway] {Meal Type acquired} (3)
      (2) edge node [midway] {Meal Time acquired} (3);
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{figure}


But what if a user makes a faulty entry and wants to remove it?
We need to include a system that let's users remove entries.
Knowing the date and time of an entry is enough to remove it, so we construct the frame shown in \autoref{tab:remove_frame}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption[Frame and Questions for Removing Entries]{Frame and Questions for Removing Entries}\label{tab:remove_frame}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    Slot&Type&Questions\\ \toprule
    User Id&int&-\\ \hline
    Meal Date&Date&What was the date of this entry?\\ \hline
    Meal Time&Time&What was the time of this entry?\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Based on \autoref{tab:remove_frame}, we construct a control structure for entry removal, shown in \autoref{fig:remove_control}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption[Control Structure for Removing Entries]{Control Structure for Removing Entries}
  \label{fig:remove_control}
  \scalebox{0.5}{
  \begin{tikzpicture}[control]
    \node (0) {Start};
    \node (1) [below =of 0] [state] {What was the date of this entry?};
    \node (2) [below =of 1] [state] {What was the time of this entry?};
    \node (3) [below =of 2] {Remove Entry};
    \path[->]
      (0) edge (1)
      (1) edge node [midway] {Meal Date acquired} (2)
      (2) edge node [midway] {Meal Time acquired} (3);
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Before logging any meals, however, we need to know some things about the user.
For example, user's timezone.
It is not possible to obtain accurate time information without knowing the user's time zone.
For the overall system, we also need to know the user's dietary goal.
Both of these informations must be acquired at first contact with the user.
Based on this, we build the frame and questions seen in \autoref{tab:reg_frame} for user registration.
We derive the timezone from user's location.
The dietary goal is represented as an integer, corresponding to:

0: Lose Weight

1: Mainting Weight

2: Gain Weight


\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption[Frame and Questions for User Registration]{Frame for User Registration}
  \label{tab:reg_frame}

  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}

    Timezone&text&Please share your location with me so I can find your timezone.\\ \hline
    Goal&int&Please select your goal.\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Based on \autoref{tab:reg_frame}, we construct the control structure shown in \autoref{fig:reg_control}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption[Control Structure for User Registration]{Control Structure for User Registration}
  \label{fig:reg_control}
  \scalebox{0.5}{
  \begin{tikzpicture}[control]

      (1) edge node [midway] {Timezone acquired} (2)
      (2) edge node [midway] {Goal acquired} (3);
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{figure}


We also contruct two more control structres, for changing timezone and goal settings, shown in \autoref{fig:change_control}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption[Control Structures for Changing Timezone and Goal]{Control Structures for Changing Timezone and Goal}

                      trim right=(3),
                      >=stealth,
                      shorten >=1pt,
                      auto]
    \node (0) {Start};
    \node (1) [below =of 0] [state, text width=5cm] {Plese share your location with me so I can find your timezone.};
    \node (2) [below =of 1] {Change Timezone};
    \node (3) [right =of 0, xshift=3cm] {Start};
    \node (4) [below =of 3] [state] {Please select your goal.};
    \node (5) [below =of 4] {Change Goal};
    \path[->]
      (0) edge (1)
      (3) edge (4)
      (1) edge node [midway] {Timezone acquired} (2)
      (4) edge node [midway] {Goal acquired} (5);
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{figure}

We also need to send messages at predicted times and ask for feedback on the prediction.
The control structure for sending messages and asking for feedback is shown in \autoref{fig:send_control}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption[Control Structure for Sending Messages and Asking for Feedback]{Control Structure for Sending Messages and Asking for Feedback}

    \node (2) [below =of 1] {End};
    \path[->]
      (0) edge node [midway] {Send Message} (1)
      (1) edge node [midway] {Get Feedback} (2);
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{figure}

Bringing all these control structures together, we end up with a final structure describing the entire system, shown in \autoref{fig:system_control}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Information Extraction}
We need to extract relevant information from the user's messages in order to fill the slots.
This mainly concerns extracting time and type of an entry.
For other information, we will be taking advantage of Telegram Chatbot API's various functionalities, which will be explained in the next subsection.
We will be performing information extraction primarily with the help of regular expressions.
All the mentioned regular expressions need the X flag set, allowing for whitespace within the expression.
For extracting the type of the entry (i.e. meal or snack) we will be using the regular expression shown in \autoref{fig:re_type}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
type_pattern = r'''\b
(?:
(?P<meal>meal|breakfast|lunch|dinner)|
(?P<snack>snack|small|little|few)
)
\b'''
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[Regular Expression for Extracting Entry Type]{Regular Expression for Extracting Entry Type}
  \label{fig:re_type}
\end{figure}

This regular expression matches a word from a set of words between word boundries.
If the matched word is meal, breakfast, lunch or dinner; the extracted type is set to meal.
If the matched word is snack, small, little or few; the extracted type is set to snack.


\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
r'''\b
(?:at\s*)?
(?:
(?P<hours>
[01]?\d|2[0-3])
(?:[:\.\s]
(?P<minutes>
[0-5]?\d))?
(?P<AmPm>\s*[ap]m)?
|(?P<hours_alt>[01]\d|2[0-3])(?P<minutes_alt>[0-5]\d))
\b'''
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[Regular Expression for Extracting Absolute Temporal Expressions]{Regular Expression for Extracting Absolute Temporal Expressions}
  \label{fig:re_time_a}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
r'''\b
(?P<hours>
(?:half(?:\s*\b(?:a|an|)\b\s*)?|
\ba\b|\ban\b|
1?[0-9]|2[0-4])?
\s*
(?:h|hour)s?)?
\s*
(?P<minutes>
(?:\ba\b|\ban\b|
[0-9]{1,2})
\s*
(?:m|min|minute)s?\b)?
\s*
(?:ago|before|prior)
\b'''
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[Regular Expression for Extracting Relative Temporal Expressions]{Regular Expression for Extracting Relative Temporal Expressions}
  \label{fig:re_time_r}
\end{figure}

For extracting the time of the entry, we use two different regular expressions: 
one for absolute temporal expressions shown in \autoref{fig:re_time_a}, and another for relative temporal expressions shown in \autoref{fig:re_time_r}.
From here on, in order to avoid confusion between regular expressions and temporal expressions, 
we will be referring to the regular expressions as extractors.

Absolute time extractor matches any phrase that has a hour part; a single or double digit number between 0 and 23.
It also optionally matches a minutes part; a single or double digit number between 0 and 59.
The hours and minutes parts need to be seperated by a delimiter; either a colon, a period or a space.
After the hours and minutes parts, if there is a phrase signifying 12 hour format (am-pm), the phrase is also matched.
Alternatively, the extractor also matches military time; a four digit representation where the first two digits signigy hours and last two digits signify minutes. (e.g 2000)

Relative time extractor matches phrases followed by a trigger word.
This word can be ago, before or prior.
Preceeding the trigger word, hours part, minutes part or both can be matched.
Hours part is a single or double digit number between 0 and 24, followed by a word signifying hours (h, hours etc.).
Minutes part is a single or double digit number between 0 and 99, followed by a word singifying minutes (min, minutes etc.).
Additionally, the extractor also matches the word 'half' if it preceeds the hours part.
After the extraction, relative time is normalized based on the user's timezone.

When we get a message from the user, we first run the relative time extractor on the text.
To understand why, consider the phrase `I ate 5 minutes ago'.
While this is clearly a relative temporal expression, it is also matched by absolute temporal expression.
However, relative time extractor involves trigger words.
This means that if the relative time extractor matches a phrase, it is safe to assume that the phrase is a relative temporal expression.

We have a final regular expression shown in \autoref{fig:re_log}
We use this expresssion to determine if a user is trying to log an entry.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
r'''\b
(eat|ate|eaten|food)
\b'''
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[Regular Expression for User Intent]{Regular Expression for User Intent}
  \label{fig:re_log}
\end{figure}

Similar to the type expression, this expression matches a word from a set of words between word boundries.
The words that can be matched are; eat, ate, eaten and food.
We use this expression only if both time and type expressions fail to match anything.
This is because if the previous expressions match a phrase, then the intent is already established.

\subsection{Implementation}
Instead of developing a stand-alone application, we build our dialog agent as a Telegram chatbot.
This makes the development process significantly easier.
Instead of focusing on application design, we can fully focus on our dialog agent.
We build our dialog agent using Python 3 and python-telegram-bot library, which provides a python interface for Telegram Bot API.

In the previous subsection, we have mentioned that we would be using some Telegram Bot API functionalities in order to make information extraction easier. 
We will start this subsection by explaining these functionalites.
Next we will move on to the control structure of a Telegram chatbot.
Finally, we will briefly mention some other libraries that are also used in our implementation.
\subsubsection{python-telegram-bot Library}
\subsubsection{Telegram Bot API}
There are some Telegram Bot functionalities that we make use of in order to make information extraction easier.
First of those are the chatbot commands.
Telegram Bot API allows user to perform actions via commands.
A command is a string of alphanumerical characters and underscores, all of which is preceeded by a '/' character.
For example, '/help', '/set\_nickname' or '/command3' or all viable commands.
In our system, we use commands to start any operation other than logging an entry.
We implement a total of four commands:

\paragraph{/start} command is automatically called when a user messages our chatbot for the first time. This command initiates the registration sequence shown in \autoref{fig:reg_control}. Registered user's can not call this command.

\paragraph{/change\_timezone} command initiates the timezone changing sequence shown in \autoref{fig:change_control}. 
This command can be called at anytime after the registration. 

\paragraph{/change\_goal} command initiates the goal changing sequence also shown in \autoref{fig:change_control}. 
This command can also be called at anytime after the registration.

\paragraph{/remove\_entry} command initiates the entry removal sequence shown in \autoref{fig:remove_control}. 
This command can also be called at anytime after the registration.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
	\centering
        \captionsetup{width=\linewidth}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/commands}
        \caption{Screenshot Showing Available Commands for the Chatbot}
	\label{fig:commands}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
	\centering
        \captionsetup{width=.9\linewidth}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/keyboard}
        \caption{Screenshot Showing an Inline Keyboard}
	\label{fig:keyboard}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

We also make use of Inline-Keyboard functionality to decrease information extraction effort.
Inline-Keyboards are collections of custom buttons, each with their own text and callback values.
For any situation where a user needs to choose from a finite set of alternatives, we send an Inline-Keyboard.
This significantly limits the need for information extraction, as the user directly tells us what we need to know.
We use Inline-Keyboards for:

\paragraph{Selecting goals} 
We send a Inline-Keyboard with three buttons. 
Each button displays a goal from our list of dietary goals. 
When the user presses on a button, we receive an integer value corresponding to the selected goal.

\paragraph{Picking up a date for entry removal} 
We send an interactive calendar built as an Inline-Keyboard.
When a user selects a date, we receive a datetime object corresponding to the date selected.
We use \texttt{telegramcalendar.py} script in order to create these interactive calendars.
\texttt{telegramcalendar.py} script is written by Github user unmonoqueteclea.
The repository contatining the script can be seen at:

\texttt{https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot}

\paragraph{Picking up a time for entry removal} 
After the date selection, we send the user an Inline-Keyboard with buttons containing the entry times for that date.
When the user picks a time, we get the string representation of the time selected.

\paragraph{Getting Feedback on Notification Timing} 
When we send a message at a predicted time, we also send a Inline-Keyboard for feeback.
This keyboard contains five buttons: Too Early, Early, On Time, Late and Too Late.
When the user presses a button, we get an integer corresponding to the button pressed.

One last thing to mention is how we get the user's timezone information.
Telegram allows users to send their locations.
Instead of performing any information extraction, we ask the user for their location.
When we receive the location, we use it to find user timezone.

\subsubsection{Control Structure}
Telegram chatbots are mainly controlled by Updater and Dispatcher objects.
Updater object receieves updates from Telegram and passes them to the Dispatcher object.
Dispatcher object, in turn, passes the update to the suitable Handler objects.

Each Handler object accepts a predefined set of updates, and passes these updates to the associated functions, which then process the update.
Telegram Bot API offers a wide variety of Handler objects.
In our implementation, we will be using:

\paragraph{CallbackQueryHandler} handles updates containing callback queries, which are results of user interaction with Inline-Keyboard. 

\paragraph{CommandHandler} handles updates that are results of chatbot commands.
Each CommandHandler handles a specific command.

\paragraph{MessageHandler} handler updates that are results of telegram messages.
It is possible to filter messages based on type. (text, image etc.)

\paragraph{ConversationHandler} is an aggregate of multiple handlers. 
ConversationHandler objects are designed like finite state automatas where handlers are the states.
For every ConversationHandler, there are three sets of handlers.
The first is a list of entry points, determining what starts the conversation.
The second is a dictionary of states and handlers, determining which handler acts at which state.
The last is list of fallback handlers.
These handlers are called when no other handler in a given state is capable of handling an update.

It is clear to see that our control structures can easily be translated into ConversationHandler objects.
We simply create handlers for every state in our control structures, and tie them together using conversation handlers.
We implement a total of 5 conversation handlers:

\paragraph{Registration} This conversation handler has the /start command handler as its entry point. 
It contain two states, one that asks for the user's timezone and the other that asks for the user's goal.
The handler that corresponds to the first state is a message handler, filtering for messages containing locations.
The handler that corresponds to the second state is callback query handler, intented to process the user's goal selection.
There is also another message handler that accepts any message as a fallback.
This handler reminds the user that the registration needs to be completed in order to continue.

\paragraph{Changing Timezone} This conversation handler has the /change\_timezone command handler as its entry point.
It contains only one state, which coressponds to a message handler that filter for messages containing locations.
The fallback handler for this one accepts any message and cancels the operation, returning the chatbot to the idle state.
This handler cancels the current operation and returns the chatbot to the idle state.

\paragraph{Changing the Goal} This conversation handler has the /change\_goal command handler as its entry point.
It also only contains one state, a callback query handler intended to process user's goal selection.
This conversation handler also has a fallback handler that cancels the operation.

\paragraph{Removing an Entry} This conversation handler has the /remove\_entry command handler as its entry point.
It has two states, both of which correspond to callback query handlers.
The first one is for processing date selection, and the second one is for processing time selection.
This conversation handler also has a fallback handler that cancels the operation.

\paragraph{Meal Logging} This conversation handler is unique in the way that it has a message handler as an entry point.
It has three states, all of which are message handlers that filter for text messages.
The first one is the same as the entry point.
The second one is intended to extract type, and the thirds one is intened to extract time.
When a user sends a text message, the initial handler tries to extract the time and the type of the entry.
If it extracts both, the entry is saved into the database
If it extracts only one, it transitions into other state based on the missing information.
If it extracts none, it runs the regular expression shown in \autoref{fig:re_log} in order to determine if the user is trying to log an entry.
If the pattern matches a phrase, the handler tries to get the information required.
If this pattern also matches nothing, the chatbot returns to the idle state.
This conversation handler also has a fallback handler that cancels the operation.


In addition to the conversation handlers, we implement a callback query handler to handle feedback on predictions.

\subsubsection{Other Libraries}
We use other libraries to implement some additional functionality not offered by python-telegram-bot library.

For scheduling messages to be sent at predicted times, we use the 'schedule' library.

For deriving timezones from locations, we use the 'timezonefinder' library.

Finally, for converting timezone information stored as text into timezone objects, we us the 'pytz' library.

\section{Machine Learning}
In this section, we will go through the machine learning component of our system.
Much like any machine learning pipelin, we will start with data preprocessig.
Afterwards, we will take a look at the models used.
Finally, we will end this section on model seleciton and prediction.

We use pandas \parencite{pandas} and numpy \parencite{numpy} libraries for data manupilation.
For creating, training and testing our models, we use the scikit-learn \parencite{scikit-learn} library.
\subsection{Preprocesseing}
We will be going through some of the standard steps of preprocessing.
\subsubsection{Cleaning the Data}
Data neads to be cleaned before being fed into the model.
We have to make sure that there are no rows with missing values,
and that each column has the same data type for every row.

After inspecting our data, we see that there are indeed no missing values.
However, we realize that the meal time values aren't saved uniformly.
The current system stores meal time in 'hours:minutes: format.
However, there are some entries from the early stages of the system, 
where the meal time is stored as\\
'hours:minutes:seconds.microseconds+timezone'.\\
We solve this problem by applying the function shown in \autoref{fig:code_clean} to meal time values.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
lambda x:x[:5]
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[Cropping Function for Time Values]{Cropping Function for Time Values}
  \label{fig:code_clean}
\end{figure}

This function simply returns the substring containing the first 5 characters of the input string.
Values that are 5 characters long ('hours:minutes' values) aren't affected.
For any other value, the return value corresponds to the 'hours:minutes' part, rendering the data uniform.

After making sure that our data is uniform, we sort our values based on meal date and meal time for further processing.
\subsubsection{Feature Extraction}
We need to craft more expressive features from our input values.
We also need to craft a target value (label) that is dependent on our features.
After some brainstorming we decide on the features shown in \autoref{tab:features} and the target value shown in \autoref{tab:target}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption[Features]{Features}
  \label{tab:features}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    Feature&Explanation\\ \toprule
    Day of the Week&Day of the week as a one-hot encoded feature value\\ \hline
    Meals so far&Number of meals the user had on the particular date\\ \hline
    Snacks so far&Number of snack s the user had on the particular date\\ \hline
    Last Entry Type&Type of the last entry, 0 for snack and 1 for meal\\ \hline
    Last Entry Time&Time of the last entry, represented in minutes\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \caption[Target]{Target}
  \label{tab:target}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    Target&Explanation\\ \toprule
    Time Until Next Entry&Time until next entry, represented in minutes\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We convert our base input values to feature vectors using the code shown in \autoref{fig:feature_template}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]

  \begin{tabular}{c}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=python, breaklines, breakatwhitespace]
def feature_template(data):

    snack_count = 0
    counter = 0
    meal = 0
    first = True
    for row in data:
        if first:
            current_datetime = datetime.strptime(row[1]+' '+row[2], 
                                                    '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
            meal = row[3]
            first = False
            continue

        new_datetime = datetime.strptime(row[1]+' '+row[2], 
                                            '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
        new_data[counter][int(current_datetime.strftime('%w'))] = 1
        new_data[counter][7] = meal_count
        new_data[counter][8] = snack_count
        new_data[counter][9] = meal
        new_data[counter][10] = int(current_datetime.strftime('%H')) * 60
        new_data[counter][10] += int(current_datetime.strftime('%M'))
        diff = new_datetime - current_datetime
        new_data[counter][11] = diff.days*1440 + diff.seconds/60
        if current_datetime.date() == new_datetime.date():
            if meal:
                meal_count += 1
            else:
                snack_count += 1
        else:
            meal_count = 0
            snack_count = 0

        current_datetime = new_datetime
        meal = row[3]
        counter += 1

    return previous_entries, last_entry

  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[]{Function for Feature Extraction (continued)}
\end{figure}
\newpage
This function takes a numpy array containing the user data and returns two objects.
The first object is pandas data frame, containing the feauture vectors and target values for every entry except the last one.
We use this data frame to train and test our models.
The second object is a numpy array, contatining the feature vector for the the last entry.
This array is meant to be used after model selection, in order to predict the time of the next entry for the user.

\subsubsection{Training and Test Set Seperation}
We need to seperate our data into training and test sets before the next step.
We do this with the help of \texttt{train\_test\_split()} function from scikit-learn library.
This function accepts an array of feature vectors (X), an array of target values (y), and a float value specfiying the size of the test set.
It returns four arrays; X\_train, X\_test, y\_train and y\_test.
We set our test size as $0.1$, meaining 10\% of the data is used for testing.

\subsubsection{Feature and Target Scaling}
After feature extraction, we end up with a feature vector.
This feature vector mostly consists of small values; usually zeros or ones, and single digit numbers for two features.
However, one feature, namely the time of entry, has a range between 0 and 1440.
Most machine learning models perform better when the features are similaryly scaled.
Because of this, we need to rescale our features.

We use \texttt{MinMaxScaler()} object from scikit-learn library for this task.
This object transforms features by scaling each feature to a given range, where the default range is betwen 0 and 1.
It works like this: First, we fit the scaler to the data using the \texttt{fit()} function.
Then we call \texttt{transform()} function on the data to scale our features.

So why did we need to seperate our data before this step?
Because fitting the scaler to the data means that the scaler learns the data.
Good data science practice dictates that the test set must contain unseen data.
As a result we fit the scaler to our training data, and then use it to transform both the training and the test data.
We also have significantly larger target values (mostly between 0 and 1440).
This might cause instability during the training phase.
Because of this, we repeat the scaling process on the target values using another scaler.

\subsection{Models}
Now that our data is preprocessed, we can feed it into our models.
We have very little data to work with.
This means that we need to use simple, lightweight models to prevent overfitting.

We use a total of 4 base models, all of which we create using scikit-learn library.
Additionally we use 4 ensemble learners based on these 4 models.
All of the models and their corresponding scikit-learn objects can be seen in \autoref{tab:models}
\texttt{SVR() kernel} parameter is selected to keep the model linear.
Other model parameters shown are selected based on trial and errork

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption[Models]{Models}\label{tab:models}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|p{6cm}}
    Model&Scikit-learn Object\\ \toprule
    Linear Regression&\texttt{LinearRegression()}\\ \hline
    Ridge Regression&\texttt{Ridge()}\\ \hline
    Support Vector Machine Regression&\texttt{SVR(kernel='linear')}\\ \hline
    Decision Tree Regression&\texttt{DecisionTreeRegressor()}\\ \hline
    Ensemble of Linear Regressors&\texttt{BaggingRegressor( base\_estimator= LinearRegression(), max\_samples=1.0, max\_features=0.7)}\\ \hline
    Ensemble of Ridge Regressors &\texttt{BaggingRegressor( base\_estimator=Ridge(), max\_samples=1.0, max\_features=0.7)}\\ \hline
    Ensemble of SVM Regressors &\texttt{BaggingRegressor( base\_estimator= SVR(kernel='linear'), max\_samples=1.0, max\_features=0.7)}\\ \hline
    Random Forest Regressor&\texttt{RandomForestRegressor( max\_features=0.7)}\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We also perform 10 fold cross validation on every base model, and hyper parameter optimization on two base models using \texttt{GridSearchCV()} from scikit-learn library.
We optimize the \texttt{'alpha'} parameter for the ridge regression between $0.5$ and $1.0$, 
and the \texttt{'C'} parameter for SVM regresssion between $0.1$, $0.5$ and $1.0$.

\subsection{Model Selection and Prediction}
After preparing our data and model, we come to the model selection phase.
The first thing we do is checking if there is an already stored model in the database.
If there is, we set this model as the best model and the model score as the best score.
If there is no stored model, we set the best model to \texttt{None} and the best score to $0$.

Next, we create, train and test the previously mentioned eight models for a number of iterations.
This number is set to $100$ if the best score is $0$, signiying that this is the first time that we train models for the user.
Otherwise, the number is set to 10.
During an iteration, if we find a model performing better than the best model, we set this model as the best model and its score as the best score.
After all the iterations are complete, we check the best model.
If it is still set to \texttt{None}, this means that all the models scored less than $0$, most likely due to insufficent data.
In this case we make no prediction.
Otherwise, we use the best performing model to predict the time until next entry.
After the prediction, we save the best performing model into our database.

\subsection{Feedback Value}
Eating is not an instantenous activity.
When users report meal times, they can report any point in time that is within the duration of the eating activity.
We use a feedback value to account for this.
When we send a user a notification, we ask for a feedback on the timing.
We save the user's feedback as an int value and use it the next time we need to make a prediction.
This feedback value denotes delay, and can be positive or negative.
When we make a prediction, we simply add this feedback value to the result.
We calculate the time of the next entry based on this final value.

\subsection{Chatbot Integration}
When a user logs a new entry, we call a function that contains the entire machine learning pipeline.
This process doesn't take long due to small amount of data available and the simplicity of the models.
We schedule a message at the precited time, and the system goes back to the idle state.
\section{Testing the System}
We give access links to volunteers consisting of university students in order to test the system.
The volunteers are asked to use the system for 15 days, and then give feedback on the experience.
